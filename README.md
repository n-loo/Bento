# nlooStartpage

This is the startpage I use which I forked from: [Bento](https://github.com/migueravila/Bento).

I've added some customizations to fit my setup better and currently it is made to go with my nord styled [Firefox CSS theme](https://github.com/n-loo/nlooFirefoxCSS).

Here is a preview!

This startpage requires the [open sans font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans).
